          <p>
            Welcome to <strong>ECHOBYTE CONCEPT</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"). These Terms and Conditions govern your participation in our internship programs and your employment with our company. By accepting an offer of internship or employment, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms and Conditions, in addition to any specific agreements (e.g., Internship Agreement, Employment Contract) that you may sign.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#facc15] mt-8">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By commencing an internship or employment with ECHOBYTE CONCEPT, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. These terms form an integral part of your engagement with us.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#facc15] mt-8">2. Eligibility and Engagement</h2>
          <p>
            **For Internships:** Internship opportunities are offered to individuals seeking practical experience and learning in relevant digital tech fields. Specific eligibility criteria (e.g., educational background, skills) will be outlined in the internship offer. Interns are not considered employees unless explicitly stated otherwise in a formal employment contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            **For Employment:** Employment is offered to qualified individuals based on company needs and successful completion of our recruitment process. All employment is "at-will" unless a specific written contract or collective bargaining agreement states otherwise. This means either you or ECHOBYTE CONCEPT may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, subject to applicable laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            All engagements (internship or employment) are subject to verification of credentials, background checks, and adherence to company policies.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#facc15] mt-8">3. Code of Conduct and Company Policies</h2>
          <p>
            All interns and employees are required to adhere to ECHOBYTE CONCEPT's Code of Conduct, internal policies, procedures, and guidelines, as they may be updated from time to time. These policies cover, but are not limited to, workplace behavior, professionalism, attendance, use of company resources, and data security. You will be provided access to these policies and are expected to familiarize yourself with them.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#facc15] mt-8">4. Compensation and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            **For Internships:** Internship compensation, if any, will be clearly communicated in your internship offer letter or agreement. Interns are generally not eligible for employee benefits unless expressly stated.
          </p>
          <p>
            **For Employment:** Details regarding your salary, wages, and eligibility for employee benefits (e.g., health insurance, paid time off) will be outlined in your employment contract or offer letter, and are subject to company policies and applicable laws.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#facc15] mt-8">5. Confidentiality</h2>
